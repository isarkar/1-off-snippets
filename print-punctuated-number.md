# Problem
## Given a signed integer, output a string representation of the number with commas separating the thousands.

Question:
---------
**Input:** A signed integer.

**Required output:** A string representing the input integer, with the sign and with commas separating the thousands.

_e.g._, given an input of `-1234`, the output will be a string `"-1,234"`.
For a positive number, there's no need to output the `"+"`.

Assumptions:
------------
1. You can make any assumptions about the width of the input integer (`int32`, `int64`, anything that you wish).
2. Use any programming language that you are comfortable with.
3. The objective here is to make sure that you can explain the algorithm you are using to solve the problem -- so, just picking an existing library function to do the conversion (either the entire conversion, or a major part of it) is not an acceptable answer.
4. A few unit tests to exercise your code is an added bonus.
